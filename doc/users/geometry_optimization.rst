-------------------------------
Running a geometry optimization
-------------------------------
In the following we will assume to have a valid user input file for the water
molecule called ``h2o.inp``, e.g. like this

.. include:: h2o_geopt.inp
    :literal:

A geometry optimization can be run by adding GeometryOptimizer section to any normal .inp file and setting the run keyword to true:

.. include:: geopt_section.inp
    :literal:

This will start a geometry optimization with the default settings.

-------------------------
Obtaining accurate forces
-------------------------

In the above H_2O input example the world_prec parameter is chosen really small. This is necessary to get accurate forces. 
If it is chosen higher, the geometry optimization may not converge. Pay attention to the warning

    WARNING: Noise in force is larger than 0.2 times the larges force component!!!

    Geometry optimization onvergence cannot be guaranteed!!!

This is printed when the noise level is too high. Usually, geometry optimizations will not converge when this warning is printed.
In that case, either decrease the world_prec, the orb_thrs or increase the convergence criterion of the geometry optimization.

--------------------------
Pre-relax input geometries
--------------------------

Running high precision multi resolution wavelet calculations is computationaly expensive.
It is therefore not advisable to use an input geometry with high forces, a small world_prec and start the simulation.
An optimized workflow would look something like this:

1. Optimize the geometry with a gaussian basis set. This can be done with a number of gaussian basis set codes
2. Use inaccurate forces (world_prec ~ 1e-4) and a rather large convergence criterion (max_force_component ~ 1e-2) for the
   geometry optimization for a pre-relaxation with MRCHEM.
3. Do a tight geometry optimization (max_force_component ~ 5e-4) and with an accurate MRCHEM calculation (world_prec ~ 1e-6)

--------------
Reuse orbitals
--------------

For tight geometry optimizations where the input structure is already close to the local minimum (using cheaper pre-relaxations), it makes sense
to use the orbitals from the geometry optimization iteration *i* for the start of iteration *i+1*. This feature can be enabled by setting

    use_previous_guess = true

-----------------------------
Choosing an initial step size
-----------------------------

If there are some problems in the first couple of geometry optimization iterations (energy and force norm increasing) the initial step size should be chosen
manualy. If a conservative choice (init_step_size ~ 0.8 ) does not solve the problem, the problem is usually in the input 
geometry (wrong units, unphysical, ...) or in the potential energy surface (too much noise, error in the dft input section, ...).

Convergence problem can be analyzed by visualizing the optimization trajectory and plots of the energy and force norm versus the geometry optimization iterations.
